# 📚 Dictionary Management System

A comprehensive C++ application that emulates a traditional dictionary while introducing efficient digital features. Built using Data Structures and Algorithms, this project allows users to add, delete, update, and search for words, inspired by the functionality of platforms like Google Dictionary.

## 🚀 Introduction

The **Dictionary Management System** is a user-friendly, C++-based project that focuses on:

- Managing words and their meanings effectively
- Delivering a smooth and intuitive user experience
- Implementing core DSA concepts (like trees) for efficient data operations

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### 1. `LoadDictionary()`

- Loads words from `Dictionary.txt` at startup
- A loading screen enhances the user experience
- Uses a tree structure for optimal word storage and fast lookups

### 2. `AddWord()`

- Checks if the word already exists
- If not, prompts user to enter a **word** and its **meaning**
- Stores the new word for future reference
- Prevents duplication and provides feedback

### 3. `SearchWord()`

- Redirects users to the search page post-load
- Users can enter a word in the textbox
- Displays meaning if found, or "Word not found" message otherwise
